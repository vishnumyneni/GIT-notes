Steps to use multiple git users in one machine

1.If a global user already exists generate ssh key for new user (update email and key name)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "newuser@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_newuser

2.Add key to ssh agent (use your key name)
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_newuser

3.Add the generated pub key to your github account(C/Users/name/.ssh/is_rsa_newuser.pub)

4.Create config file in C/Users/name/.ssh folder
nano ~/.ssh/config

5.Paste below in config file
# Default GitHub account (optional - only if you already use this)
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# New GitHub account (this is what you need)
Host github-newuser.com #use this as alias
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_newuser
  IdentitiesOnly yes

6.Set repo specific user name
git config user.name "New User"
git config user.email "newuser@example.com"

7.Now try to clone using ssh(remember to change the host to github-newuser)
git clone git@github-newuser.com:username/repo.git


If you face Could not resolve hostname, run these
ssh-keygen -R github.com #to reestablish the key in known_hosts
ssh -T git@github.com #reconnect old user
ssh -T git@github-newuser.com #reconnect new user
You should see
Hi newuser! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Try cloning now.
